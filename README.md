# PHP

**1.What is PHP?**
- PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. It supports many databases like MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, Solid, PostgreSQL, generic ODBC, etc.

**What is the difference between "echo" and "print" in PHP?**
- Echo can output one or more string but print can only output one string and always returns 1.
- Echo is faster than print because it does not return any value.
